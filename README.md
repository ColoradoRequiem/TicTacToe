# TicTacToe - Thomas Mahre and Fahad Shaik

Person 1 - Thomas Mahre
Person 2 - Fahad Shaik

The repository contains code for PE4:

This is a simple progam that allows two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. It works by first initializing a blank 2D 3-by-3 array, then allowing the player to choose any one of those spots to fill with either an "X" or an "O", depending on the turn number. Player 1 will always use "X", Player 2 will always use "O".

In order to run the program, simply run "g++ -std=c++17 -o a.o main.cpp" to compile the program, then "./a.o" to run it.
